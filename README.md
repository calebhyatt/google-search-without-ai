# Remove AI from Google Search

I got tired of getting AI answers when using Google Search. Sometimes the answers are helpful, but personally I just want a regular Google search.

This extension automatically removes the AI answer from your Google searches by adding `udm=14` to the URL.

## How to install

1. Download this repository by clicking the green **Code** button on the top right of this page, then click **Download ZIP** and unzip the folder.

2. Open the **Extensions** tab in your browser, then click **Load Unpacked** and select the unzipped folder. If Load Unpacked isn't there, enable Developer Mode in your browser settings.

3. Enjoy Google Search as it was meant to be!
